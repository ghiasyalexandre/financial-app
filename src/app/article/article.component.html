        Saving money is not quite as fun as spending it, but money in
        the bank can be a lifesaver when you’re hit with unexpected
        expenses or a sudden job loss. When your bank account balance is
        down to just a few dollars, it can feel like saving money is
        impossible. If you struggle to save money, know that you’re not
        alone. Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults (44 percent) could cover
        the cost of a $1,000 emergency with savings, according to
        Bankrate’s recent annual emergency savings report. You might
        think you need to make more money in order to save, but there
        are actually plenty of other ways you can start your nest egg
        today rather than tomorrow, ranging from simple habits to
        innovative digital budgeting tools.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">
        Write down your savings goals
      </h3>

      <p>
        Having specific goals can help you save more money. Write down
        your savings goals or save them in a spreadsheet, and assign
        them names (like “emergency fund” or “new car fund”) and
        deadlines. Then, identify how much to set aside each month to
        have the full amount when you’ll need the money. Using multiple
        savings accounts can also help you meet your goals, since you
        can devote one account to each goal and easily track your
        progress. This also enables you to easily shift your funds to
        take advantage of the savings account in your portfolio that
        offers the highest interest rate. An alternative strategy is to
        use a single bank that lets you create categories — sometimes
        called buckets — within the same account that allow you to save
        toward different goals. Examples of such accounts are the Sallie
        Mae SmartyPig account and the Ally online savings account.
